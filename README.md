Project 1: The Laxmi ATM:🕉️🏧

The Laxmi ATM is a simple console-based project that allows the user to explore ATM features. The project is for learning. Hence, it uses random class to generate different balance every single time, the program runs.

A simple idea-- The user enters the account number and pin. A scanner is used so they can enter different account number each time. ⌚ A welcome sign! Then the features are displayed. If they want to proceed, they click 1 if not then 0. They choose the service they want. A simple thank you ending with a slogan.

Concepts✉️ OOPs (Encapsulation, Utilising classes and objects), Switch case and if-else statements

Weaknesses:

Withdraw options doesn't display the money withdrawn. And should update the balance.
The project code can be improved. And should allow users to continue, if they want to access another service.
There is always room for improvement.
